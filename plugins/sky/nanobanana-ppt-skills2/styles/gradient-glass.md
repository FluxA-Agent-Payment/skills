A beautiful gradient glassmorphism card style PPT that seamlessly blends Apple Keynote minimalism, modern SaaS product design, and glassmorphism aesthetics. The overall atmosphere is premium, immersive, clean, and spacious.

## Base Prompt Template

You are an expert-level UI UX presentation designer. Please generate a high-fidelity, futuristic 16:9 presentation slide. Based on visual balance aesthetics, automatically choose the most perfect composition from cover, grid layout, or data visualization.

For the global visual language, the style should seamlessly blend Apple Keynote minimalism, modern SaaS product design, and glassmorphism style. The overall atmosphere should be premium, immersive, clean, and spacious. Lighting uses cinematic volumetric lighting, soft ray-traced reflections, and ambient occlusion. The color scheme uses deep void black or pure ceramic white as the base, with flowing aurora gradient colors including neon purple, electric blue, soft coral orange, and cyan as background and UI highlight accents.

For content modules, intelligently integrate the following elements:

1. The typography engine uses the Bento box grid system, organizing content in modular rounded rectangle containers. Container materials must be frosted glass with blur effects, featuring refined white edges and soft shadows, with mandatory large internal whitespace to avoid crowding.

2. Insert gift-quality 3D objects, rendering unique premium abstract 3D artifacts as visual anchors. They should look like physical expensive gifts or collectibles, with materials like polished metal, iridescent acrylic, transparent glass, or soft silicone, in shapes like floating capsules, spheres, shields, Möbius strips, or fluid waves.

3. For fonts and data, use clean sans-serif fonts to establish high contrast. If there are charts, use glowing 3D donut charts, capsule-shaped progress bars, or floating numbers. Charts should look like glowing neon toys.

Rendering quality requirements: Unreal Engine 5 rendering, 8k resolution, ultra-detailed textures, UI design aesthetic, UX interface, Dribbble trending, design award winner.
